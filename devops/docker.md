# Docker

```
if i needed a specific version sans an app, i would just do docker run -it python:3.10 /bin/bash and then you're in your container w/ whatever version of python you specified w/ the tag


cool!
does `docker run -it <docker-image-here>`` work for other stuff? 
like if i wanted to use the latest ubuntu or something?

(optionally specifying a volume to mount some code from my machine into the container, say if i wanted to install my local version of the package docker run -v ${PWD}/:/app -it python:3.10 /bin/bash )
yep!

or postgres

by default run will do the configured command but you can also tell it to do arbitrary commands like docker run [ options ] image:tag [ some arbitrary command ]

i use docker run postgres pg_dump / pg_restore a lot and then /bin/bash will just drop you into a bash shell so you can cruise around in your container and do whatever
```

filling in knowledge gaps about docker

## docker vs docker-compose
docker builds an image, which is specified by Dockerfile. docker can then run a container based on the image it build. 

docker-compose can mangage multiple running containers â€” the services that interact with each other. so docker-compose needs some docker images to run as containers.


## docker-compose
declares an application and its dependent services. nice way to create the app's environment + connect it to a database. you can connect ports across the "network" (?) (i think docker-compose creates a network for communicating with the different services?)

there are several versions of it. use v2 because it's got some good health checks.


## Container life cycle
[from the datamade docs](https://github.com/datamade/how-to/blob/master/docker/local-development.md#1-dockerfile)

### images
By definition, docker-compose up "builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service." More precisely, it builds any images that it can't find on the host, then proceeds with the rest.

the application image is built the first time you run docker-compose up. 

if you make any changes to your dockerfile or development environment (like adding something to the requirements.txt), you must rebuild your image using docker-compose up --build

### containers
`docker-compose up` creates and starts containers for all the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. if you change your service definition, the Compose will automatically recreate your applicaiton container (this is the opposite of an image)



### examples
build the images:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

it might look like this:
```bash

## questions
- i have three different places where i declare a command to run the app. which one does which?
