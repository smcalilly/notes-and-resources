how to think about statistics for stories

why statistics?
- a new way of thinking about your story
- predict outcomes
- explain outcomes
    - harder to measure things and explain
- provide falsification. don't do enough of it in journalism.

### journalism vs social science thinking

#### journalism
- confirming tips thru data. "how many people have covid today"
- documenting a pattern
- answering specific questions
- limited to the place and time
- newsworthy?

#### social science
- develop formal hypotheses
- evaluate measures that might provide insights i
- test hypotheses

#### example
hypothesis: AZ sholarship tax credit for school choice has failed to meets its promise of improving the state schools.

what's the evidence would you use to disprove?
- amount of tax credit
- education outcome / performance measure
- demographics

#### what's the alternative?
- how would i know if i failed to?


### falsification as a goal
- stress test your idea. what if everything is wrong?
- what would your measures tell you if you were wrong?
    - are you using measures that you would know if you were wrong?
- narrative: produce stories which sometimes overshadow evidence. how to marry the two...statistics and narrative?

## evidence
- hypothesis: one-hit wonders are more common today than in years past.
- evidence: billboard hit 100 positions; platinum album sales
- measurement: what makes a one-hit wonder?

you need ground truth.
- need to think about it if you're ground truthing or if you're coming up with a measure that you want

## cognitive biases
- confirmation
- attribution
- availibility
  - can we get the data in a reasonable amount of time. what can we get?
- survivorship
  - the wwii plane example. calling police incident reports crime. education data, what about the missing students?
- sunk cost

is this really happening the way i think it is? it's easy to go out and find the story that you want.

what bias exists in your data? asks, how and why might they be wrong?

what about missing data? write about what data is missing, instead of writing about the bad data story.

i wonder if, or state it as a hypothesis

## the null
the alternative or null hypothesis
- stats benchmark against the null or the no

need a hypothesis and question: do some people have to travel farther to vote?

simpson's paradox

disproving the hunch is a hypothesis

do evictions occur in black and latino areas. need to control for poverty? multiple regression will be critical here.

statistics can't show motivation and active discrimination

causation is very very hard so be cautious. sometimes the best we can do is association or correlation.

can compare before / after? what are you comparing against, what is your benchmark that you're comparing against?

causation, disprove the cause instead of prove it.

## stats does
- state hypothesis: h1
- alternative hypothesis:
  - always assume that nothing is going on, test against 

p value, p05
.05?
- R.A. fisher decided this number
- it's a benchmark, it's not the only one. you can have a lower value
- accepted by convention and tradition, it's a realistic acceptance of the fact that we're complex people and complex society


we should never use the word statistical significance - jordan ellenberg. read 'how not to be wrong'

the difference between significant and meaningful. the law of small numbers. little things mean a lot. 

all of statistics are built on a sample.
- T test, was yeast growing more in one batch than another. can't take the entire batch, so take a sample.

p value: given that the null hypothesis is true, what are the chances?
if the null hypothesis is true, there's a less than 5% chance that it's true. what's the chances that it's random chance?

statistics is the science of probability.

hot hand is a myth. we can have streaks, but streaks are normal. random events can happen, but we're looking for what happened is more random.

not: this zipcode has a more normal amount of cancer, what you're saying is what are the chances that every zipcode everywhere doesn't have an abnormal amount of cancer.

## r
chi-square, aka a cross tabulation. comparing for counts

if there is no relationship, the chance of this data occuring, is 11%
p-value = 0.112

can see if something is going on, but not telling you why. tells you that something is worthy of investigation.

want at least 30 in the observed sample

look up "type 2 error"

## T test
comparison between two groups, comparing two means

ggplot, "not a lot of difference in the two middle groups"

**variance**, all statistics need some variance.

## coorelation
medium strength correlation

regress aka "move towards the mean"
