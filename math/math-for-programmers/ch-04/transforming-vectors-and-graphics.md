# transforming vectors and graphics
vector in -> rotate function -> rotated vector out

you can think of the `rotate` function as a machine that takes in a vector and outputs an appropriately transformed vector.

if we apply a 3D analogy of this function to every vector of every polygon defining a 3D shape, we can see the whole shape rotate.

if instead of rotating by 45* once, we rotated by one degree every 45 times, we could generate frames of a movie showing a rotating teapot.

[[linear transformations]] are a broad class of vector transformations that, like rotations, send vectors lying on a straight line to new vectors that also lie on a straight line.

have numerous applications in math, physics, and data analysis.
