a linear transformation is a vector transformation *T* that preserves [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]]. that is, for any input vectors u and v, we have:

*T*(u) + *T*(v) = *T*(u + v)

and for any pair of scalar *s* and a vector *v*, we have:

*T*(sv) = s*T*(v)

linear transformations respect the algebraic properties of vectors, preserving sums, scalar multiples, and [[linear combination]]s.

they also respect the geometric properties of collections of vectors, sending line segments and polygons defined by vectors to new ones defined by the transformed vectors.


broad class of vector transformations that, like rotations, send vectors lying on a straight line to new vectors that also lie on a straight line.

have numerous applications in math, physics, and data analysis.
