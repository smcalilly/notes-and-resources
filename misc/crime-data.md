## early crime data
### w.e.b du bois
- the philadelphia book
- read his university of pennsylvania essay
- Positivism
- Data telling the truth of the world can not always lead to truthy. the politics of interpretation, the politics of data collection. 

White collar crime and how it’s measured differently
- criminal justice system might be different than what’s reported on in the data
- data literacy 

- polling, early 1900s when people start to do polling
- most voters say that crime is bad. but that conflicts with reality. where does this come from?

- 1904 atlanta university crime poll

### ida b wells-barnett
asking questions about how people interpret data. 
recognizing different outcomes of crime punishment based on race. 

her pamphlets about lynching. 
ran out of town for suggesting that black men and white women were in consensual relationships. her paper was burned. 
came back to the south. 
black sharecroppers massacred for trying to unionize in Arkansas. 

- “the reason why”
- “a red record”- lynchings in the united states, mid 1890s

- she engages with the crime data and calls into question the crime data itself.

- racial criminalization = the stigmatization of crime as “black” and the masking of crime amongs whites as individual failure
- read “the condemnation of blackness” by kahil Muhammad 

## early national crime data
- see racebox.org

- 1850 census, counting prisoners
- 1880 census and 1890 census created data that confirmed white people bias

### uniform crime report
- wanted a uniform way of tracking
- cops wanted it so they could evaluate the “crime wave” in the 1920s and respond to it
- social scientists and the moral statistics movement wanted crime data, too

- ucr today: voluntarily submitted by law enforcement agencies or the state’s program

when does something become a crime? if it’s reported? if they’re charged? convicted?

- 2019 was last piece of big data from 80% of law enforcement agencies
- june 2021, 44% of law agencies published crime data
- 2017, crime data explorer launched. main way for people to acces this data. most recent national data is 2019

- srs vs nbirs
historically crime data came from both. 

srs follows hierarcy rule, ranks in order of severity and accepts the report of only the most severe within an incident. might have several crimes in one incident, but they only record the most severe crime. Typically “violent crime”

when you hear “violent crime” data, you want to ask, how was it measured?  

nbirs doesn’t follow the hierarchy rule. 
changing to it might make it seem like crime is going up. hard to compare different data sets. 

crime data convos are often about how effective the police are, but that means different things to different people. 

ucr — what’s it used for?  
- used to measure police performance. 
- needs of law enforcement agencies. 
- allocate funding  

### national crime victimization surgery
- administered by the us census bureau on behalf of the bureau of justice statistics
- voluntarily reported, interviews conducted each year
- asks about reported incidents and incidents you might not have reported
- asks about the experience with criminal justice system, whether or not you reached out to police, why

origins of the ncvs
- president LBJ, first president to give a message to congress about crime, what’s happening on the local level and what can be done.
- proposed law enforcement assistance act
- national crime survey launched in 1973

what was going on in 1965 for johnson to talk about this?
- barry goldwater trying to link the social welfare state to rising crime rates

## compstat
started in 1994, using gis to map crime and conditions likely to cause crime and determine where policing should be directed and how. promoted as “scientific policing”. creates a culture of trying to beat the trend, crime is up, what is wrong, why aren’t you doing your job? or celebrate crime going down.
