what are they and why they matter?
- enrollment data — used to identify community trends, whether families are moving into districts, moving to private schools, home schools
- achievement data — not ideal to rely on the exclusively, but it's a good way to gauge how they're doing in clsoing the achievement gap
- funding data — aka poor people spending data. related to the kind of funding, academic and otherwise. often found on state department websites
- discipline data — the way schools deal with discipline.  disciplinary action, arrests, etc. can get from state departments and office of civil rights
- (was attendance data one that i missed?)

where to find it?
- national center for eductation statistics. lots of data
- office of civil rights
- state government websites
- education researchers, like UCLA lab, education week (https://www.edweek.org/research-center/)
- FOIA requests to districts

you've found data, now what?
- collection -> verification (very important in education because they often supress data) -> cleaning -> analysis -> reporting -> presentation
