# queue and bread-first search
algorithm to traverse or search in data structures like a tree or graph.

we can use BFS to do level-order traveral in a tree. we can also use it to find a path, especially the shortest path, from a start node to a target node.

we can also use BFS in more abstract scenarios, to traverse all the possible statuses.


we can use a queue to implement the BFA algorithm.
